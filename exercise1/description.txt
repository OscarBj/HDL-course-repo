HDL Exercise 1: BCD to bargraph decoder
- The inputs represent a binary value between 0 and 9
- The output consits of a 9 bit long vector, where every bit corresponds to a "led"
- If a led is turned on the output for that bit is 1, otherwise 0
- Input number maps to the number of leds that are on

- Project consists of 2 files, bargraph_decoder and bargraph_decoder_test
- bargraph_decoder contains two implementations of the decoder funcitonality
- bargraph_decoder_test acts as a testbench
	- Contains test signals that are manipulated to verify correct behaviour of the system

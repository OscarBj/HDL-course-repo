Description of exercise 3 VHDL code:
- Project consists of 2 files, counter and counter_test
- Counter contains main functionality with two architectures
- Both models use integer variables and if statements to achieve functionality
	- Architecture 1: counter_model1 is asynchronous
	- It contains all entity inputs in the sensitivity list
	- Reacts to all input signals (if ceratin restrictions are fulfilled)
	- Output is still generated periodically according to clock
	- Architecure 2: counter_model2 is synchronous
	- It cointains clock and reset in the sensitivity list
	- Reacts to clock and reset signal.

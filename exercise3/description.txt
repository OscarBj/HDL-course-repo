HDL Exercise 3: Design, Simulation and Synthesis of sequential logic
- 4 bit counter implementation
- Inputs: reset, enable, load, down/up, data
- Outputs: count, over
- The counter counts up or down, loads data and resets
- Over will output 1 when there is over/underflow on the counter

Description of exercise 3 VHDL code:
- Project consists of 2 files, counter and counter_test
- Counter contains main functionality with two architectures
- Both models use integer variables and if statements to achieve functionality
	- Architecture 1: counter_model1 is asynchronous
	- It contains all entity inputs in the sensitivity list
	- Reacts to all input signals (if ceratin restrictions are fulfilled)
	- Output is still generated periodically according to clock
	- Architecure 2: counter_model2 is synchronous
	- It cointains clock and reset in the sensitivity list
	- Reacts to clock and reset signal.

HDL Exercise 5: State machine for Led driver
- Contains states that maps to different led output beahviour
- The output consits of an RGB value
- A state defines paramters such as state duration, led color duration and RGB value
- Each color maps to a value between 0 and 255
	
	The driver will have four inputs:
	- A reset button that will go back to the STANDBY state and default settings.
	- A speed control button to iterate through the three different speed modes.
	- An iteration control button that will change from continuous loop mode (RED after
		PURPLE) to backwards loop mode (BLUE after PURPLE, GREEN after BLUE and so on).
		Note that in both modes YELLOW always goes after RED.
	- An alarm button that will trigger a 7 seconds alarm state. During this state, the
		LED will blink at a frequency 10 times faster (with respect to the frequency it had
		when the alarm was triggered). The LED color during the alarm is WHITE
		
- Continious loop state: RED – YELLOW – GREEN – BLUE - PURPLE (backwards: R->Y->P->B->G)
- Color duration is defined by input, state duration is defined by color duration times the number of states
- Standby: White, for 4 seconds

Description of exercise 5 VHDL code:
- Project consists of 3 files, driver_module, timer_module and driver_tb

- driver_module contains led driver functionality
	- 5 states are defined: off, alarm, standby, continious and backwards
	- These corresponds to rgb values which are used for assigning the output
	- Two processes manages states and the overall behaviour
		- System state is controlled by one process
		- Led state is controlled by the other process
	- One process for reacting to speed input
	- Separate processes for each RGB value
	
- timer_module countains timer functionality
	- The timer contains a general clock (125MHz) that is used for creating timed outputs
	- The timer output is a separate clock signal -> timer value corresponds to one period of the timer clock signal
	- The timer reacts to alarm so that the timer output increases its frequency by a factor of 10

- driver_tb acts as testbench for the led driver
	- Contains test signals that are manipulated to verify correct behaviour of the system
	- Screenshots are included to show how system reacted to different parameters
		- "alarm_demo" shows how the system reacts when alarm input goes from 0 to 1
			- the alarm state lasts 7 seconds and then goes to standby			
		- "loop_speed_mode_demo" shows the system reacting to changes in speed and loop mode
			- at 290ns, speed changes from "1s" (10ns) to "3s" (30ns)
			- at 390ns, speed changes from "3s" to "5s" (50ns)
			- at 490ns, loop mode changes from continious to backwards

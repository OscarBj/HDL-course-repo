Description of exercise 4 VHDL code:
- Project consists of 2 files, hex_counter and hex_counter_test
- hex_counter contains counter functionality
	- The architecture contains two processes
	- The Combinatorial process responsibility is handling most of the inputs
		- Counting, loading, over- and underflow, count direction
		
	- The Register process responsibility is handling clock and reset events
		- Writing counted values, over- and underflow, and resets to output
		
- hex_counter_test acts as testbench
	- Contains test signals that are manipulated to verify correct behaviour of the system
	- Screenshots are attached to show how system reacted to different parameters
		- "count_down" shows normal count down, right side of the image shows a underflow being raised 
		- "count up" shows normal count up, right side of the image shows a overflow being raised
		- "count_load" shows load of data 1b and counter going down
		- "counter_reset" shows reset event in the left and right side of the image

HDL Exercise 2: Loop based combination logic
- Scoring system for a game with 2 opponents
- The inputs are the points for each player
- The output is the winner

Description of exercise 2 VHDL code:
- Project consists of 2 files, tally and tally_test
- tally contains main functionality 
	- defines process that keeps two vectors in sensitivity list
	- vectors contains score that are translated into integers in a loop
	- integers are interpreted and the output is assigned
- tally_test does verification
	- defines two look up tables 
	- DUT (device under test) = tally
	- verification function 
	- and a main process
	- look up table 1 is for DUT
	- look up table 2 is for verification
	- verification function calculates the result by a simple comparison
	- process loops trough the LUT's and tests the behavior of the DUT
